# ABOUT PAGE


## About: 

My name is <strong>Wajd</strong>, and I am a skilled web developer with over three years of experience in coding and managing repositories on GitHub. I have completed the prestigious CS50s Harvard courses and recently ran a successful internship as a front-end developer with a team on June 26th, 2022. My expertise in user experience and creating user-friendly websites is unparalleled. I also have extensive knowledge in the field of backend development, such as Django and Firebase as BaaS, which makes it easier for me to work with a backend developer in teams. I am confident that my skills and experience will be an asset to your team, and I am excited about the prospect of working with you!
